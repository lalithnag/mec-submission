    <p>It was on a warm and breezy Friday afternoon that Luca, having indulged in a heavy lunch, found himself gazing at a determined squirrel
that was perched on his window sill. Clutching a stubborn nutshell with its tiny paws, the squirrel executed an array of maneuvers with
intense focus. It began by turning the nut around, testing its angles and seams, while steadily biting and gnawing with determination.
Luca couldn't help draw a parallel to the time he had spent poring over lines of code, navigating the maze of his dataset with little success.
Memories came rushing of the hours spent babysitting his model, in pursuit of a reasonable loss curve. Despite his best efforts,
the model that had performed so well on the reported data inexplicably and repeatedly failed on his dataset. The model doesn't generalize,
_it just doesn't generalize_. At that very moment, a gentle breeze swept in and comforted him. Gradually, he sensed his thoughts slowing down,
his focus dwindling and his eyelids growing heavier...when an unexpected touch on his shoulder jolted him.

    "Come with me. Now. There's no time to explain"
    "Wh..What?"
    </p>

    <h3>Chapter 1: A failed effort</h3>
    <p>And so it was, that Luca now found himself in a strange and peculiar land. He looked around in disbelief at the
landscape that stretched into a boundless expanse. What he saw seemed both familiar and foreign to him. It slowly dawned upon him,
as his eyes swept across the mountains of code in the backdrop.
Gigantic crystalline structures, intricate with complex algorithms and databases, soared towards the sky.
Interlinked nodes and circuits sprawled out like arteries, each a nexus of complex information, thoughts, and ideas. It was as if the whole world
around him was drowning in the very essence of information and understanding. Three tall structures stood immediately before him pulsating
with energy, emitting soft and harmonious hums that echoed through the city it was guarding.</p>

    <p>Suddenly, Luca's thoughts turned to the unfinished work, his model that was probably training, the cluttered desk and the creaky chair that he
left behind, all of which seemed like a world far far away from the one he was now standing in.
He was overcome with confusion regarding the nature of his journey and the identity of the woman who had accompanied
him here. As he turned toward her, he had the feeling she could sense his bewilderment, she started speaking:
Welcome to the land of DataRealm, where all data lives. The best of produce of this land is handed over to the Data
Wizard. What you now see are the three spires of data quality. Before you step into the DataRealm, you need to pay your respects
to these majestic structures, that have been built upon years of wisdom. She proceeded, </p>

    <p>These monuments stand in memory of all the data that has been abused, tortured, and sacrificed to fit a narrative.
The first monument stands for _Data Relevance_. It reminds the people stepping into this land, to always first check if they are using
data that is relevant to the task they want to solve at hand. This means, thinking about potential causal factors,
or potential confounders that can affect what kind of data is collected for the task. There is this familiar trope that Switzerland
produces the most amount of chocolate, as well as Nobel Laureates, that does not mean you begin collecting data on chocolates in order
to analyse the data on the Nobel laureates. </p>

    <p>The second structure that you see here stands for _Data integrity_. It reminds people to always have a look at the data and analyse it
before beginning to use it for a task. This sounds obvious, doesn't it? But a lot of people are guilty of not performing exploratory data
analysis. This means, looking at the data distribution, visualising histograms and pair plots, to first identify any overt outliers. Second,
checking if the data is representative of the diversity that you expect to see in the test dataset. And finally, trying to analyse the
features and their importance using techniques such as PCA, and t-SNE. Most importantly, a lot of them are guilty of using their own splits
for their experiments. For example, one person performing methodological development on a certain train test split, and another person shows
better performance but on another split of the data. This makes the methods not comparable and a lack of information prevents it from
being reproducible. </p>

    <p>Finally, the last structure stands in the name of data security. The data that is valuable to us can serve us only as long as we can protect
it, and not let it fall under the hands of bad actors. This means, ensuring anonymization, checking the data pipeline for potential
vulnerabilities. You need to check under which scope you are using the data, and if necessary apply techniques such as differential privacy
to shield sensitive data from parts of your pipeline. As Luca was taking in this information, she held his hand and moved into through the spires.</p>

    <h3>Chapter 2: Shifting shores</h3>

    <p>As soon as Luca lay foot inside the realm, he could sense the ground beneath him shifting and moving. He was not sure if it was him that
was moving or the world around him that kept changing what he could see. Ae he looked in astonishment toward her, she proceeded to explain:
The land of data is ever shifting. In the land of data, unlike where you come from, the very nature of the visions you see and exist in, can change
quite quickly. Even though your model and understanding of the world is the same. </p>

    <p>We call this covariate shift. Let me give you an example. Assume in this city, 40% of the population is within the ages of 18 and 45,
and 30% are above this range. Covariate shift means that as these people grow older, the model that you have trained on this data
also fails to perform in the same way, as the distribution changes. There are two ways of measuring this change in distribution. Firstly,
you can compare it to the original distribution of data, to see how different they are. Secondly, you can compare how this affects the performance
of your model. So even if I have trained a good model on the dataset I have, there is a chance that the model may degrade in performance over
time simply because the nature of data has changed? Yes! The model needs to be constantly updated to account for shift in data. How do I know
if the data has changed? Through a change in performance, but it is better to assume there is a shift in data and to test for it.</p>

    <p>But, keep in mind that it is not just about the data, the function describes the data itself can change. We call this _concept shift_. Here,
the underlying assumptions about the function that fits the data has to be updated by updating the model. For example, you can have a
segmentation algorithm, but there may be a new confounding factor uncovered like the ECG. In this case, the model needs to be updated.</p>


    <h3>Chapter 3: Splitting and Wizardry</h3>

    <p>Luca was taking in all this new information, wondering if he actually did these things in his model pipeline. They now reached a forest where
the purported data wizard resided. You need to pick the right data, that will lead you to the path home. There are multiple follies made
previously by those who have trodden this path. If you can avoid these, you will be able to meet the Data Wizard who will send you home. She then
proceeded to explain, 'Firstly, be aware of data leakage. You generally have the choice to split the data on multiple levels. For example,
this can be a patient-level or the sample level, or a surgery-level. You need to think what kind of split makes the most sense. For example,
if there are multiple surgical videos, it makes sense to split the frames in such a way that the surgeries do not mix. This can be ensured by
using for example the sklearn function to check for data leakage.'</p>

    <p>The second common mistake, is failing to ensure subgroups are adequately represented in your data splits. Always ensure you sample the data
in a stratified manner. This helps pick the data in such a way that there is enough representation of the subgroups
in each group. This is called stratified sampling. Additionally, if there are further hierarchies in your data,
your data split needs to reflect these hierarchies while sampling. Finally, it is quite common that you come across data classes that are very
imbalanced. This is especially true if you are trying to detect rare cases, such as rare diseases. In these cases you can turn to data augmentation
to offset this imbalance, that is by adding more data. Alternatively you can sample in a balanced manner and leave out some data.</p>

    <p>As Luca was ready to walk the path of the enchanted forest, he saw a really bright light that blinded him and heard a loud thud.
When he opened his eyes, he saw his desk and found himself fallen from his chair in his office. He quickly looks outside the window,
the squirrel was enjoying the magnificent treasures of its labour with a glint in its eye. </p>
