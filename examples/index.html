    <p>It was on a warm and breezy Friday afternoon that Luca, having indulged in a heavy lunch, found himself gazing at a determined squirrel
that was perched on his window sill. Clutching a stubborn nutshell with its tiny paws, the squirrel executed an array of maneuvers with
intense focus. It began by turning the nut around, testing its angles and seams, while steadily biting and gnawing with determination.
Luca couldn't help draw a parallel to the time he had spent poring over lines of code, navigating the maze of his dataset with little success.
Memories came rushing of the hours spent babysitting his model, in pursuit of a reasonable loss curve. Despite his best efforts,
the model that had performed so well on the reported data inexplicably and repeatedly failed on his dataset. The model doesn't generalize,
_it just doesn't generalize_. At that very moment, a gentle breeze swept in and comforted him. Gradually, he sensed his thoughts slowing down,
his focus dwindling and his eyelids growing heavier...when an unexpected touch on his shoulder jolted him.

    "Come with me. Now. There's no time to explain"
    "Wh..What?"
    </p>

    <h3>Chapter 1: A failed effort</h3>
    <p>And so it was, that Luca now found himself in a strange and peculiar land. He looked around in disbelief at the
landscape that stretched into a boundless expanse. What he saw seemed both familiar and foreign to him. It slowly dawned upon him,
as his eyes swept across the mountains of code in the backdrop.
Gigantic crystalline structures, intricate with complex algorithms and databases, soared towards the sky.
Interlinked nodes and circuits sprawled out like arteries, each a nexus of complex information, thoughts, and ideas. It was as if the whole world
around him was drowning in the very essence of information and understanding. Three tall structures stood immediately before him pulsating
with energy, emitting soft and harmonious hums that echoed through the city it was guarding.</p>

    <p>Suddenly, Luca's thoughts turned to the unfinished work and the model that was now probably training, his cluttered desk, and his chair that
squeaked when he leaned back, all of which seemed like a world far far away from the one he was now standing in.
He was overcome with confusion regarding the nature of his journey and the identity of the woman who had accompanied him here.
Just then she looked at him and started speaking:</p>

    <p>Welcome to the DataRealm, where all data lives. The best of produce of this land is handed over to the Data Wizard. What you now see are the
three spires of data quality. Before you step into the DataRealm, you need to pay your respects to these majestic structures, that have
been built upon years of wisdom. She proceeded, 'The first one that you see, is the spire of Data Relevance. It stands as a testament to the data that have been abused, tortured
and sacrificed in the name of a narrative. To all the times the data has not been checked, and has been force fit to tell a story.
Data Relevance means, spending some time thinking about possible confounders, if the data at hand is appropriate for the task that you want to solve. Secondly, we have
Data Integrity. This refers to the times the data was not checked for completeness, incomplete data was not tackled appropriately, and the data
was not explored to identify outliers and the changes in the distribution not accounted for. Finally, the third monument stands in memory of all
the times data security was neglected. Our data is beloved to us and can help us only as long as we protect them from bad actors. She now
held his hand and stepped into the DataRealm</p>

    <h3>Chapter 2: Shifting shores</h3>

    <p>He now held her hand and stepped into the city. The minute he stepped he felt the ground moving and shifting. He looked bewildered at his
companion. She calmly smiled and said 'This is a land that is constantly shifting, unlike where you come from. The data is in a
constant state of flux. Even though your model of the world is constant, we are standing on ever shifting bases. For example, think of the
scenario where we develop a model , but the data distribution itself changes. This is called covariate shift, the probability of the inputs
Secondly, the world itself can change, this means the probability of the outputs changes. In the next stage, the world itself changes,
this is called the model shift. And the model has to be updated enough to keep adapting to this change in world view.
Use this example, to change and see how the model or the distributions change the output. There are two ways to measure the performance,
one is by seeing how much the data has changed. And secondly, by seeing how much the performance has been affected as a result.'</p>

    <p></p>
    <p>he finally picked the data from the forest and stepped into a shrine. As he entered, he heard a sound and immediately remembered waking up.
      He quickly looks outside the window, the squirrel was enjoying the magnificent treasures of its labour with a glint in its eye.
