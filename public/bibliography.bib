	abstract = {An approach to the construction of classiﬁers from imbalanced datasets is described. A dataset is imbalanced if the classiﬁcation categories are not approximately equally represented. Often real-world data sets are predominately composed of “normal” examples with only a small percentage of “abnormal” or “interesting” examples. It is also the case that the cost of misclassifying an abnormal (interesting) example as a normal example is often much higher than the cost of the reverse error. Under-sampling of the majority (normal) class has been proposed as a good means of increasing the sensitivity of a classiﬁer to the minority class. This paper shows that a combination of our method of over-sampling the minority (abnormal) class and under-sampling the majority (normal) class can achieve better classiﬁer performance (in ROC space) than only under-sampling the majority class. This paper also shows that a combination of our method of over-sampling the minority class and under-sampling the majority class can achieve better classiﬁer performance (in ROC space) than varying the loss ratios in Ripper or class priors in Naive Bayes. Our method of over-sampling the minority class involves creating synthetic minority class examples. Experiments are performed using C4.5, Ripper and a Naive Bayes classiﬁer. The method is evaluated using the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUC) and the ROC convex hull strategy.},

	abstract = {Machine learning brings the hope of finding new biomarkers extracted from cohorts with rich biomedical measurements. A good biomarker is one that gives reliable detection of the corresponding condition. However, biomarkers are often extracted from a cohort that differs from the target population. Such a mismatch, known as a dataset shift, can undermine the application of the biomarker to new individuals. Dataset shifts are frequent in biomedical research, e.g.,  because of recruitment biases. When a dataset shift occurs, standard machine-learning techniques do not suffice to extract and validate biomarkers. This article provides an overview of when and how dataset shifts break machine-learning–extracted biomarkers, as well as detection and correction strategies.},

The COVID-19 pandemic, which caused unprecedented stress on healthcare systems around the world, presented what seems to be a perfect opportunity for AI to demonstrate its usefulness. However, of the several hundred medical imaging AI models developed for COVID-19, very few were fit for deployment in real-world settings, and some were potentially harmful. This review aims to examine the strengths and weaknesses of prior studies and provide recommendations for different stages of building useful AI models for medical imaging, among them: needfinding, dataset curation, model development and evaluation, and post-deployment considerations. In addition, this review summarizes the lessons learned to inform the scientific community about ways to create useful medical imaging AI in a future pandemic.},

Four practicing academic radiologists annotate a test set, on which we compare the performance of CheXNet to that of radiologists. We find that CheXNet exceeds average radiologist performance on the F1 metric. We extend CheXNet to detect all 14 diseases in ChestX-ray14 and achieve state of the art results on all 14 diseases.},

	abstract = {CAUSAL INFERENCE IN STATISTICS A Primer Causality is central to the understanding and use of data. Without an understanding of causeeffect relationships, we cannot use data to answer questions as basic as Does this treatment harm or help patients? But though hundreds of introductory texts are available on statistical methods of data analysis, until now, no beginner-level book has been written about the exploding arsenal of methods that can tease causal information from data. Causal Inference in Statistics fills that gap. Using simple examples and plain language, the book lays out how to define causal parameters; the assumptions necessary to estimate causal parameters in a variety of situations; how to express those assumptions mathematically; whether those assumptions have testable implications; how to predict the effects of interventions; and how to reason counterfactually. These are the foundational tools that any student of statistics needs to acquire in order to use statistical methods to answer causal questions of interest. This book is accessible to anyone with an interest in interpreting data, from undergraduates, professors, researchers, or to the interested layperson. Examples are drawn from a wide variety of fields, including medicine, public policy, and law; a brief introduction to probability and statistics is provided for the uninitiated; and each chapter comes with study questions to reinforce the readers understanding.},

	abstract = {While the importance of automatic image analysis is continuously increasing, recent meta-research revealed major flaws with respect to algorithm validation. Performance metrics are particularly key for meaningful, objective, and transparent performance assessment and validation of the used automatic algorithms, but relatively little attention has been given to the practical pitfalls when using specific metrics for a given image analysis task. These are typically related to (1) the disregard of inherent metric properties, such as the behaviour in the presence of class imbalance or small target structures, (2) the disregard of inherent data set properties, such as the non-independence of the test cases, and (3) the disregard of the actual biomedical domain interest that the metrics should reflect. This living dynamically document has the purpose to illustrate important limitations of performance metrics commonly applied in the field of image analysis. In this context, it focuses on biomedical image analysis problems that can be phrased as image-level classification, semantic segmentation, instance segmentation, or object detection task. The current version is based on a Delphi process on metrics conducted by an international consortium of image analysis experts from more than 60 institutions worldwide.},
